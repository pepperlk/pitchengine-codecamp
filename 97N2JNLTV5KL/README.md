#cameron whiting code camp 2012

## currently working on version 6, **xorXavier**

## website, version 5, **mavelousMarcus** can be found at:
[home server](http://69.145.68.236:10200)

> My continuing mission is to provide syntax that
> will hopefully make someone *cry* blood;

### changes
* singular next/prev buttons; I.E. "one switch to rule them all!"
* only two mediaqueries, making debugging/developing both less of a hassle.

### structure of website:
* starting tour (include header)
* the tour: switch through slides**
* the end: tiles to click on (with a popup to try Linux Mint or Fedora)

## planned features in version 6, **xorXavier**
* reuse $(window).height statement to divide up container height
* slide the entire 'background'; I.E. create background 'slides'.
* squish most of the last annoying formating bugs
* allow the slides to advance (in portrait mode or with touch screen) by touch
* create a true 'reversable' statement, even if it means more logic switches.
     * I plan to streamline the code as it goes along.

## proposed features:
* make 'title' the button they click on for 'sidenav' ONLY in portrait mode
    * how do I do that?
        * could have an invisible clickable div hover over the title
