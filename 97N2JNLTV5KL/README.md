I will uncomment the twitter bootstrap later.
I will probably use .delay functions to change the background (.css)
and match that to a .delay function to fade in a transparent div (.fadeTo)

I still don't know what's up with c9's .slideDown and .slideUp,
and yes, the site delivers insecure content from my ip... yeah...


so, since the opacity property is kind-of ireversable on the children
of an element, I'm going to have to position the carousel manually
ontop of it's (no longer) parent div. so, yeah :D

derp. I'm going to switch the wrappers so the div in the back is transparent.
derp.
