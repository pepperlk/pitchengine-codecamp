Questions for Kristen on Thursday:
how do I fix the button(s) on the bottom of my page
how do I go about making a carousel from scratch (I think I'll use z-index)
how do I fix the .wait/.delay functions in my jquery
slideDown and other functions don't want to cooperate at times.
also, if you could help me connect my .css and .js media queries.
