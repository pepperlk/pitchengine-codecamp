#cameron whiting code camp 2012


###releases(more like bug fixes/features) & goals:

##notes:
* each bug fix part of the code is ID'd so that I can find out what bug you're talking about.
* Technically they're not releases because they're (obviously not true code) all nonfunctional/buggzy versions.
* you can consider this the 'vanilla' code (no I'm not torvalds)

#V5 marvelousMarcus (Online @ homeserver index.html)
* implement a slide data structure (replaces static webpage design)
* this one is technically enough of a change to be a 'release'...

#v.6 livelyLunar (Online @ c9 dev.html)
* make slide backgrounds visible (bug fix)

#V.7 zoeticZarya
* finalize the tour to end smoothly at fedora/LM (feature)

#V.8 xorXavier (currently need help from lee on this one.)
* implement a singular 'inteligent' case statement. (bug fix)
* technically this bug is a hard one to crack.

#V.9 rakishRumaldo (as in a website that is: Trim and fast-looking, with streamlined angles and curves.)
* make it fast. make it seem faster. (tweaking)

#V1.0 kemptKristen
* finalize the structure of the website to run efficiently on a single interface (cross platform tweaks)
* I did notice some bugs on my dad's htc one... might have to use media queries ..again.

#V1.1 licitLee
* somehow mention microsoft or something. (that's for you guys.)

#V1.2 jazzyJason (lively or bright)
* make the website color scheme work better. icon final touches.

#casey
* codedrops
* icomoon (redo the icon to have layered svg. turns out gimp does /not/ do svg ...)
* fontawesome
* sidenav/wrap the whole page (sorry, kinda don't want a side nav anymore...)
* will be using $(window).height (gracias to the team) to scale the buttons, eventually.

#lee
* teamview server
* Microsoft Virtual Accademy (please let student licenses be free...)
