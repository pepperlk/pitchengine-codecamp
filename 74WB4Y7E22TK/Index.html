            <h1>Daniel Lobera</h1>
            <p>This page is going to be set aside for random thoughts that pop
            into my head on a daily basis. Maybe in the future it will become a
            blog for me, but for now I just want a place to document my
            discoveries, curiousities, and plans for the future.</p>
            
            <p>To start off, I'll begin by telling a little about myself. To
            keep it plain, my intrests:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Soccer:</strong> I love the sport, and the memories
                I've gained from it.</li>

                <li><strong>Video Games:</strong> Like most kids my age, I like
                kicking back with some friends and an x-box.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Movies:</strong> I like the artistic aspect of film,
                and the amazing special effects they're able to add to it.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Weight Training:</strong> While althought I am new to
                to it, I have found a keen liking to Lifting.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Coding:</strong>Again, I'm new to it, but I can tell
                that I'm going to continue enjoying it.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>And with every list of likes, comes a list of dislikes. Mine are
            as follows:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bad Breath:</strong> I hate it when I have bad
                breath without minty gum or tic tacs at hand.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Pickles or Pickle-Sickles</strong>Many people around
                Lander dig the whole pickle-sickle thing...I don't.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Excessive Insect gatherings:</strong>Don't get me
                wrong, I understand the whole equilibrium thing, but really...
                they can suck.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So now that I've established a little bit of information about
            myself, I can start to share some of the things on my mind. Mostly,
            questions or answers to questions for things that I ponder.</p>
