            This page is going to be set aside for random thoughts that pop
            into my head on a daily basis. Maybe in the future it will become a
            blog for me, but for now I just want a place to document my
            discoveries, curiousities, and plans for the future.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            To start off, I'll begin by telling a little about myself. To
            keep it plain, my intrests:
            </p>
            
            <ul style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px;">
                <li>
                <strong>Soccer:</strong> I love the sport, and the memories
                I've gained from it.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <strong>Video Games:</strong> Like most kids my age, I like
                kicking back with some friends and an x-box.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <strong>Movies:</strong> I like the artistic aspect of film,
                and the amazing special effects they're able to add to it.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <strong>Weight Training:</strong> While althought I am new to
                to it, I have found a keen liking to Lifting.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <strong>Coding:</strong> Again, I'm new to it, but I can tell
                that I'm going to continue enjoying it.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
            
            <p>
            And with every list of likes, comes a list of dislikes. Mine are
            as follows:
            </p>
            
            <ul style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px;">
                <li>
                <strong>Bad Breath:</strong> I hate it when I have bad
                breath without minty gum or tic tacs at hand.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <strong>Pickles or Pickle-Sickles</strong> Many people around
                Lander dig the whole pickle-sickle thing...I don't.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <strong>Excessive Insect gatherings:</strong> Don't get me
                wrong, I understand the whole equilibrium thing, but really...
                they can stink.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
            You may notice that my list of dislikes is shorter than my list
            of likes. Even though it's abreviated, I do tend to like more things
            than hate. Because life's too short to hate a lot.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            So now that I've established a little bit of information about
            myself, I can start to share some of the things on my mind. Mostly,
            questions or answers to questions for things that I ponder. This
            will be a weekly occurence for me. Let's start with my first
            question:
            </p>
            
            <h2><strong>Week 1</strong></h2>
            
            <h3>
            <strong style="color: darkgrey;">What's going to be better, the
            X-box 1, or the PS4?</strong>
            </h3>
            
            <p>
            Coming around the corner is possibly the most competative holiday
            season for each Microsoft and Sony. Why? Because it is the first
            time that they will be releasing their gaming consoles at the same
            time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The two companies have always competed for sales, but now they
            are going to make the buyers choose between one console or the
            other. Where do I stand on the topic? I personally own an x-box 360,
            but come holiday season, I'll be extending my hand toward the PS4.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Why? I beleive that Sony is taking the gaming experience a better
            direction. They're correcting their mistakes they saw in the PS3
            wheras Microsoft is adding to their problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            That's just my opinion, but I know that each system is going to
            do well as far as total grossing sales.
            </p>
           
           <h2>Week 2</h2>
           
            <p>
            Glad to be back, now on to my second question:
            </p>
            
            <h3>
            <strong style="color: darkgrey;">What is the most important
            qualities to have as a player in soccer?</strong>
            </h3>
            
            <p>
            It's no secret that I love the game of soccer. Often I think of the 
            most important thing to be good at in order to be effective in the
            game of soccer. For me, there are three important things:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>An able and focused body:</strong> When I say that,
                I am mainly talking about the requirement of weight training in
                one's daily life. Without a big, muscular, fast body, it's hard
                to be effective on the soccer feild. espeshally in high school
                or older.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Knowlege and love of the game:</strong> Why even
                bother trying to get good at something without love of it? After
                all, the more you want to learn about something, the more you
                will probably try to learn about it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Perfect touch on the ball:</strong>Being able to
                move the ball in whatever way you want is critical. It's vital
                in order to be good and effective on the feild.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                I have tried to limit my list down to one, but decided that all
            three are necessary in order to become a great soccer player.
            </p>
            
            <p>So theres my quesion for this week, I'll try to keep posting more
            and more every week. But for now, I'm out.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            
            <p>
                I was thinking a lot about the ballon d'or award this week,
            specifically how Messi won it four times in a row. I imagined how
            Christiano Ronaldo felt after being let down for four painful years.
            So I thought of the perfect question:
            </p>
            
            <h3>
                <strong style="color: darkgrey">Who is the better player, Messi
                or Ronaldo?</strong>
            </h3>
            
            <p>
            Usually, I have an opinion on the matter I'm discussing. However
            in this particular verses battle, I can't state whether one player
            is better than the other. I'll explain why too.
            </p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            
            
            
            
        </body>
