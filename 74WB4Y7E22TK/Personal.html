            <h3>Life:</h3>
            
            <p>I am a fifteen year-old boy in Lander Wyoming. I plan on going to LVHS this fall for Freshman year. It will be my first year of high school, but I think it will be a good one. I own a three year-old chocolate lab named Lobo. I wish I could get as excited about walks as he does!</p>
            <p>I was originally born in Fairfax County, Virginia. For their I lived the first 2 to 3 years of my life. We then moved out to Lander, Wyoming. I love it here and would be happy if I lived here until I graduate from high school. Right now I am spending one of the best summer's of my life haning out with friends, learning how to program, and playing lots of soccer. Which leads me to the next section.</p>

            <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soccer:</strong>
                    Ever since I could walk I remember trying to kick a soccer ball with or without my dad. Now I am going into high school and looking forward to playing on our school's team!
                </li>
                <br >
                <li><strong>X-Country Running:</strong>
                    The last couple of years i've competed on our middle school X-country team. It can be really gratifying to do well in races. After running the first year, I decided to start doing races out-side of school. To this day I still run competative 5 and 10ks.
                </li>
                <br >
                <li><strong>Coding/Software Developing:</strong>
                    Even though I'm new to it and I still have a lot to learn, I can tell that this is something I could do for a long time. Maybe it's even something that I could go to college and get a job for it.

            This Agentinian winger plays a style of soccer that I believe is the best example of art in motion on the pitch.

            The founder of Pitchengine gives me the inspiration to become an entrepreneur one day too. Maybe of an internet company.
